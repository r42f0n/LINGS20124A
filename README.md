Part 2. Allophony in te Reo Māori (10 marks)

The data show that there are two ways of pronouncing the alveolar plosive /t/ in te reo Māori: [t̪] and [t̪s]. For people who have grown up speaking te reo Māori from birth or early childhood, the phoneme /t/ is articulated with the tongue touching behind the teeth. This is represented with the dental diacritic [ ̪ ], as in [t̪].
Use the data to prove that [t̪] and [t̪s] are allophones of a single phoneme /t/ in te reo Māori.
1.   Record the distribution of each allophone in the table below:[t̪][t̪s]         
2.   Explain where each allophone occurs. Consider whether it is the preceding phonological environment or the following phonological environment (or both) that affects the articulation of /t/.
3.   Finish the formula below, to predicts where speakers will use each allophone. Make your formula as general as possible.

Part 3. Morphology in an African language (10 marks)
tulilaba kitabo
‘we will see a book’
tuligula katabo
‘we will buy a little book’
baalaba bitabo
‘they saw books’
tulilaba butabo
‘we will see little books’
balilaba kitabo
‘they will see a book’
tulilaba bitabo
‘we will see books’
baatunda butabo
‘they sold little books’
baligula bitabo
‘they will buy books’
baagula katabo
‘they bought a little book’
tutunda bitabo
‘we sell books’
1.   Identify the following lexical morphemes in the data:
book
   see
   
sell
   
buy
   
2.   Identify the following grammatical morphemes in the data:
Verb Morphology
Noun Morphology
we (1pl)
   
singular 
   
they (3pl)
   
singular small
   
past
   
plural 
   
future
   
plural small
   
3.   Now compare the new data with the previous data set. There is an allomorph of one of the morphemes that you identified for question 2. Identify the allomorph and explain where it occurs, in terms of the following phonological environment. Write a formula to express the distribution of the allomorph. Your formula should take the form. X : Y / ___Z (X is articulated as Y before Z).
4.   
twaalaba kitabo
‘we saw a book’
twaagula bitabo
‘we bought books’
twaatunda kitabo
‘we sold a book’


Complete the formula by replacing X, Y and Z
X 
: Y
/ ___ Z

Part 4. Allomorphy in an Austronesian language of Sulawesi, Indonesia (10 Marks)

In these data sets, two prefixes are illustrated. In Data Set 1, the prefix adds the meaning of ‘one’ to a noun root. In Data Set 2, the prefix adds the meaning of ‘do unintentionally’ to a verb root. The purpose of this analysis is to analyse the prefixes, and establish the underlying form. of each prefixes that is stored in the head grammars of speakers.
1.   Record the different allomorphs of each prefix, and the environments in which they occur.sa-         toŋ-         wuras            -giok         
2.   Explain where each prefix allomorph occurs. Do this by identifying the pattern of phonologically conditioned allomorphs that occur in the data. Decide which prefix form. is the underlying form. Explain your choice of underlying form.
3.   Propose a formula/rule for each set of prefix allophones to explain how speakers select the correct form. of the prefix when they are speaking. Make your formula as general as possible.
